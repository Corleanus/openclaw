# Session: GUIDEBOOK Seam Entries for Dormancy + TOFU Auth
Date: 2026-02-10
Session: 5 (backfilled — /endsession ran but log was not saved)

## Flow
Followed up on session 4's note that GUIDEBOOK needed new seam entries for dormancy + approval auth. Added two full seam playbooks with touch points, core invariants, checklists, and test pointers. Updated seam coverage status from 23 to 25.

## Where We Left Off
GUIDEBOOK seam entries complete. All architecture docs work for dormancy + TOFU auth is done.

## Work Completed
- Added Agent Dormancy seam to GUIDEBOOK index table (line 50) with risk scenarios
- Added Connection Approval (TOFU Auth) seam to GUIDEBOOK index table (line 51) with risk scenarios
- Wrote full "Change Agent Dormancy" playbook (lines 1225-1263): touch points (12 modules), 12 core invariants, 6-item checklist, test suggestions
- Wrote full "Change Connection Approval (TOFU Auth)" playbook (lines 1265-1317): touch points (14 modules), 20 core invariants, 8-item checklist, test suggestions
- Updated seam coverage status from "All 23 seams" to "All 25 seams" (line 1321)

## Files Changed
- `docs/architecture/GUIDEBOOK.md` — Two new seam index rows, two full playbooks (~90 lines), updated coverage count

## Decisions Made
- Dormancy seam covers store, cache, gate, tool, system prompt, all channel monitors, and plugin runtime API
- TOFU Auth seam covers pair HTTP, rate limiting, ban management, auth resolution, WS bypass, config schema, runtime state, agent tool, gateway methods
- Both seams include suggested test files (none exist yet)

## Notes
- /endsession was run but the session log was not written to disk — backfilled on 2026-02-11
