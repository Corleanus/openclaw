# Session: B+ Gateway Testing + Web Search Research
Date: 2026-02-12
Session: 3

## Flow
Two-part session. First: B+ headless gateway manual testing. Install failed from Claude Code bash (non-elevated), clarified ONLOGON trigger inherently needs admin (not stored state). User ran from admin PowerShell — install/stop/restart all verified, no visible window. Second: user brought a list of 6 web search tools for evaluation. Researched all in parallel. LangSearch looked promising but turned out cloud-only (just a README on GitHub, no source code). User wants self-hosted + free. SearXNG emerged as the real solution — mature metasearch engine with JSON API, MCP server already exists, Docker self-hostable. Handed off for deep dive next session.

## Snapshot
None

## Where We Left Off
B+ verified. Web search research done — SearXNG selected for deep dive. Handoff written at `context/handoffs/current.md`.

## Work Completed
- B+ gateway manual testing: install, stop, restart all verified working
- Evaluated 6 web search/scraping tools (Firecrawl, LangSearch, Titan Sight, Groqqle, Crawl4AI, public-apis)
- Eliminated non-viable options (cloud-only, scrape-only, immature)
- Identified SearXNG as best self-hosted web search candidate
- Found existing SearXNG MCP server and LiteLLM integration
- Read Echo's memory from backup (`Desktop\openclaw-backup\workspace\memory\2026-02-04.md`)

## Files Changed
- `docs/architecture/PROJECT_PRIMER.md` — added Windows daemon/schtasks gotcha section
- `context/sessions/2026-02-12_session-3.md` — this session log
- `context/handoffs/current.md` — SearXNG research handoff

## Decisions Made
- `schtasks /Create /SC ONLOGON` requires admin — accepted, user runs install from admin terminal
- Option 1 (admin terminal) over Option 2 (Startup folder rewrite) — not worth rewriting daemon layer
- LangSearch rejected — cloud-only SaaS, no source code, startup risk
- SearXNG chosen for deep dive — self-hosted, free, mature, has MCP server

## Learnings
- Claude Code bash runs non-elevated — cannot create ONLOGON scheduled tasks
- LangSearch (langsearch-ai/langsearch) GitHub repo contains only a README — no actual source code
- Firecrawl and Crawl4AI are scrapers, not search engines — different use case
- SearXNG is the de-facto self-hosted web search with existing LLM integrations

## Notes for Next Session
- Deep dive into SearXNG: Docker setup, JSON API config, MCP server evaluation
- Design integration approach for OpenClaw (MCP vs native tool vs plugin)
- B+ is done — gateway running headlessly
- 37 pre-existing test failures remain (28 BlueBubbles mock, 9 gateway CLI harness)
