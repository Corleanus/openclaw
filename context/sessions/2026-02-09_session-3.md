# Session: GUIDEBOOK Phase A Complete + Phase B Providers & Extensions
Date: 2026-02-09
Session: 3

## Flow
Continued directly from session 2 plan. Phase A (seam completion) was already done — session started by reading starthere context, then immediately moved to Phase B: provider playbooks. Key technique: launched all 6 core provider explore agents in parallel (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage). Some background agents returned empty output files — had to re-launch Signal twice. Wrote all 6 provider playbooks in one edit under Channels+Delivery. User then asked for 3 major extensions (msteams, voice-call, memory-lancedb) — launched in parallel again. Placed msteams+voice-call under Channels+Delivery, memory-lancedb under Memory+Search (since it's a memory backend, not a channel). Voice-call agent also had empty output — re-launched synchronously.

## Snapshot
None

## Where We Left Off
Phase A + Phase B done. 23 seams FULL, 4 supplemental playbooks with invariants, 6 core provider playbooks, 3 extension playbooks. Remaining: additional extension playbooks (googlechat, matrix, line, feishu, memory-core) — scope undecided.

## Work Completed
- Wrote 6 core provider playbooks (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage) under Channels+Delivery
- Wrote 3 extension playbooks (MS Teams, Voice Call under Channels+Delivery; Memory-LanceDB under Memory+Search)
- Updated GUIDEBOOK "Current Seam Gaps" section twice (after providers, after extensions)
- Updated handoff twice (after providers, after extensions)

## Files Changed
- docs/architecture/GUIDEBOOK.md - added 6 provider playbooks + 3 extension playbooks, updated seam gaps
- context/handoffs/current.md - updated Phase B status (core providers done, 3 extensions done)

## Decisions Made
- Memory-LanceDB placed under Memory+Search seam (not Channels+Delivery) since it's a memory backend
- MS Teams and Voice Call placed under Channels+Delivery since they're channel/communication extensions
- Provider playbooks use `#### Provider: X` format; extension playbooks use `#### Extension: X` format

## Learnings
- Background explore agents occasionally return empty output files — need to check and re-launch
- Parallel agent launching (6 at once) works well for independent provider explorations
- Each provider has 20-100+ files; the explore agents handle ~30-45 tool calls each to build comprehensive summaries

## Notes for Next Session
- Remaining extension candidates: memory-core, googlechat, matrix, line, feishu — user hasn't decided scope
- Phase C (file-level deep reading) is ongoing/unbounded
- The GUIDEBOOK is now structurally complete for practical use — remaining work is additive depth
