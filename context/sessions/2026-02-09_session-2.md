# Session: GUIDEBOOK Phase A — Seam Completion
Date: 2026-02-09
Session: 2

## Flow
User provided a detailed 6-category plan for GUIDEBOOK seam coverage completion. Plan was ready to execute — no analysis needed, just mechanical implementation. Key technique: edited bottom-to-top within the file to avoid line-shift cascading across edits. Categories 1-4 were the structural work; Category 5 was updating the "Current Seam Gaps" section and handoff. Read starthere skill mid-session per user request — restored context from primer, last session log, and handoff before continuing. All Phase A work completed in one session. Phase B (provider playbooks) and Phase C (deep reading) remain.

## Snapshot
None

## Where We Left Off
Phase A complete. GUIDEBOOK has 23 seams at FULL, 4 supplemental playbooks with invariants, link understanding integrated into Media Pipeline. Handoff updated. Next work is Phase B: per-provider channel playbooks starting with WhatsApp (already deeply read).

## Work Completed
- Added Primary tests: blocks to 7 formerly-PARTIAL seams (CLI Boot, Gateway Boot, Gateway Protocol, Tools+Sandbox, Plugins+Extensions, Channels+Delivery, Control UI+Canvas Host)
- Added Core invariants + Primary tests to 4 supplemental playbooks (Gateway WS Method, WS Connect/Auth/Pairing, Channel Plugin, Slash Command/Directive)
- Wrote 3 new seams with full playbooks (Process+Concurrency, Terminal+Rendering, Browser Control) — index rows + touch points + invariants + checklists + test pointers
- Added link understanding subsection to Media Pipeline (invariants + checklist items 5-6 + test pointer)
- Rewrote "Current Seam Gaps" section to reflect 23/23 FULL
- Updated handoff to reflect Phase A complete

## Files Changed
- docs/architecture/GUIDEBOOK.md - 7 test citation blocks, 4 invariant+test sections, 3 new seam playbooks, link understanding subsection, rewrote seam gaps section
- context/handoffs/current.md - rewrote to reflect Phase A complete, remaining = Phase B + C

## Decisions Made
- Edited bottom-to-top to avoid line-shift issues across multiple edits in same file
- Media Pipeline now includes link understanding as a subsection (not standalone seam) per plan
- Slash Command/Directive playbook got slightly different test file names than plan specified (used more specific names: commands-builtin, commands-plugin, get-reply-directives)

## Learnings
- Bottom-to-top editing strategy works well for multi-edit sessions on a single file
- Verification counts (grep for section headers) are a fast way to confirm all edits landed

## Notes for Next Session
- Phase B starts with WhatsApp provider playbook (already deeply read from prior sessions)
- Then Telegram (largest/most complex), Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage
- Provider playbooks go as subsections under Channels+Delivery seam, not standalone
- Phase C (deep reading) is ongoing/unbounded and doesn't block GUIDEBOOK completeness
