# Session: Doc Audit and Gap Analysis
Date: 2026-02-09
Session: 1

## Flow
User asked to review docs for problems. Initial sweep found branding remnants, CHANGELOG duplication, broken links, stale content. User fixed all issues, I verified each fix thoroughly (parallel agents against every file). User then surfaced deeper architecture doc issues (build instructions, bad file ref, incomplete seam index, dist/ labeling) — verified those too. Key pivot: user asked "how far are we from the goal?" which shifted from fix-verify cycles to a quantified gap analysis. That analysis revealed the real state: hygiene is done but seam coverage is ~70%, with 9 undocumented code areas and zero per-provider/extension playbooks. Updated handoff to reflect this instead of the previous version which framed remaining work as polish.

## Snapshot
None

## Where We Left Off
Handoff updated to reflect verified state. No code or doc changes made this session — purely audit and verification. Three scope decisions pending for next session (see handoff).

## Work Completed
- Full doc audit: branding, links, changelog, outdated content, architecture accuracy
- Verified all user fixes (4 parallel verification passes, every issue checked against actual files)
- Verified GUIDEBOOK.md seam coverage: scored each seam on 4 criteria (owner modules, invariants, test pointers, change playbook)
- Verified PROJECT_PRIMER.md accuracy: spot-checked claims against source code (95%+ accurate)
- Mapped all src/ directories (69 total) against documented seams — identified 9 substantial undocumented areas
- Sampled 12 user-facing doc files for accuracy (all clean)
- Quantified the gap: 14/20 FULL, 4 PARTIAL, 2 STUB, 9 undocumented, 0 per-provider, 0 per-extension
- Rewrote handoff to reflect actual state

## Files Changed
- context/handoffs/current.md - rewrote to reflect verified gap analysis, replaced polish-focused remaining work with structural work items and scope decisions

## Decisions Made
- Remaining `clawdbot` references in PROJECT_PRIMER (legacy state dirs), updating.md (compat shim), and formal-models CI workflow are intentional — not bugs
- CHANGELOG attribution inconsistency in older versions left as historical (only 2026.2.2 was standardized)
- channel-web.js ESM parenthetical in PROJECT_PRIMER classified as minor (technically accurate, not blocking)

## Learnings
- Previous handoff understated remaining work by framing structural gaps as polish. Always quantify against the stated goal, not just against what was recently fixed.
- Parallel verification agents are effective for exhaustive checks — 4 agents covering different issue categories caught everything without overlap.

## Notes for Next Session
- Three decisions needed before continuing: seam scope, provider/extension playbook scope, Opus 4.5 policy (see handoff)
- Highest-impact undocumented seams are likely browser (70+ files, touched for any automation work) and commands (150+ files, touched constantly)
- No git repo in this workspace — use content-based scans only
