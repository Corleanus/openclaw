# Session: PRIMER Seam Routing Restructure
Date: 2026-02-10
Session: 1

## Flow
Plan was pre-approved: restructure PROJECT_PRIMER.md to route into GUIDEBOOK.md seam playbooks. User gave 4 tweaks mid-flight: (1) route by task verbs not subsystem names, (2) add "How to use these docs" workflow section, (3) keep new sections minimal (what/where/gotcha/seam-ref), (4) use heading text not line numbers. Applied all 5 plan changes with tweaks. Post-review caught 3 issues: GUIDEBOOK:1220 over-claimed all seams have checklists (Exec Approvals doesn't), router used short seam names instead of exact GUIDEBOOK headings, non-ASCII arrows leaking mojibake. Fixed all three. Open question: whether "FULL" coverage requires a Checklist on every seam - left to user.

## Snapshot
None

## Where We Left Off
All changes applied and verified. User's clarifying question about Exec Approvals checklist requirement unanswered (their call).

## Work Completed
- Added "How To Use These Docs" section near top of PRIMER (3-step workflow: Primer -> GUIDEBOOK seam -> run tests)
- Added Seam Router table with task-verb routing ("If you're trying to...") for all 23 seams + provider/extension sub-routes
- Added `> **Seams:**` inline pointers to all 12 existing PRIMER sections
- Added 8 new brief sections for uncovered seams (Memory+Search, Security+Audit, Hooks, Cron, Logging+Redaction, Process+Concurrency, Terminal+Rendering, Browser Control)
- Replaced "Where To Start Reading Next" with updated guidance referencing both docs
- Updated GUIDEBOOK cross-reference to mention routing relationship
- Post-review fixes: tightened GUIDEBOOK:1220 checklist claim, fixed canonical seam name mismatches (Gateway Boot -> Gateway Boot (Runtime Wiring), Nodes -> Nodes (Device Boundary)), replaced all non-ASCII arrows with ASCII

## Files Changed
- `docs/architecture/PROJECT_PRIMER.md` - Added How To Use These Docs, Seam Router table, 20 inline seam pointers, 8 new brief sections, replaced Where To Start, fixed seam name mismatches, normalized arrows to ASCII
- `docs/architecture/GUIDEBOOK.md` - Updated cross-reference (line 11), tightened seam coverage claim (line 1220) to honestly report missing checklists

## Decisions Made
- Task-verb routing over subsystem-name routing in the Seam Router table (user preference, better for time-pressure navigation)
- Exact GUIDEBOOK heading text used as canonical seam names (Ctrl+F/anchor reliability)
- ASCII `->` over Unicode arrows (copy/paste stability across renderers)
- GUIDEBOOK checklist claim tightened rather than backfilling missing checklists (honest reporting over false completeness)

## Learnings
- Seam names in cross-references must match the exact `### Change <Seam Name>` heading in GUIDEBOOK - short forms cause Ctrl+F misses
- Non-ASCII characters (arrows, em dashes) cause mojibake in some terminal/diff renderers - standardize to ASCII in docs consumed by tools
- When claiming "all X have Y", verify every X actually has Y before writing the claim

## Notes for Next Session
- Exec Approvals seam in GUIDEBOOK still lacks a Checklist section - add one if "FULL" coverage requires it
- If new seams are added to GUIDEBOOK, update both the Seam Router table and add an inline `> **Seams:**` pointer in the corresponding PRIMER section
- The `-> Provider subsections` and `-> Extension subsections` router entries assume those subsections exist in GUIDEBOOK under Channels+Delivery and Memory+Search respectively
