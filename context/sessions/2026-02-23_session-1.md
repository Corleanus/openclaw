# Session: OpenClaw Upstream Update + Full Compatibility Fixes
Date: 2026-02-23
Session: 1

## Flow
Major upstream update (2026.2.3 → 2026.2.23) via wholesale replacement + surgical re-apply of windowsHide. Post-update: gateway config validation failures led to adding legacy migrations for auth.mode and whatsapp.enabled. 4 parallel Codex agents found additional windowsHide gaps and migration issues. All fixed and pushed.

## Where We Left Off
All complete. Gateway running clean on v2026.2.23 with openclaw-mem0.

## Work Completed
- Updated repo to upstream v2026.2.23 (commit 8da10c9)
- windowsHide: 39 spawn sites across 32 files (commits f971ad3 + 47ed672)
- Legacy migrations: auth.mode "approval"→"token", whatsapp.enabled removal
- Fixed plugin-auto-enable for per-account channels
- User config migrated, memory slot switched to openclaw-mem0
- 3 commits pushed to Corleanus/openclaw

## Decisions Made
- Cron catch-up fix skipped (upstream improved)
- Unix-only/node-pty spawn calls left without windowsHide
- Upstream behavioral changes (legacy env vars, Tailscale auth) left as-is

## Notes for Next Session
- Monitor: legacy env vars silently ignored, Tailscale header auth WS-only, hooks.token collision check
- @discordjs/opus build scripts warning
