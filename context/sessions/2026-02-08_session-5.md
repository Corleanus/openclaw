# Session: Endsession + Detailed Tomorrow Handoff
Date: 2026-02-08
Session: 5

## Flow
User's main risk was context loss from compaction, so the session focused on writing down the "operational truth" immediately: not just what files were read, but the exact next reading order and what to extract. Another practical issue surfaced: several markdown files had BOM/smart-quote encoding artifacts, so those were normalized to ASCII to keep future diffs and copy/paste stable.

## Snapshot
None

## Where We Left Off
Deep-read coverage is strong for gateway/plugins/outbound and large parts of agents (Pi runtime, sandbox, sessions/subagents, skills, transcript hygiene). Next work is to finish the remaining OpenClaw core tools and then deep-read auth profiles and model selection/compat/fallback, followed by a second extension channel sample.

## Work Completed
- Rewrote the handoff into a strict, ordered "continue tomorrow" checklist with explicit file order and extraction goals.
- Normalized session logs and architecture docs to ASCII (removed BOM and smart quotes) to reduce future context/diff noise.

## Files Changed
- context/handoffs/current.md - rewrote into an explicit next-steps checklist with strict file order and extraction goals.
- context/sessions/2026-02-08_session-5.md - session log.
- context/sessions/2026-02-08_session-1.md - removed BOM from the header line.
- context/sessions/2026-02-08_session-3.md - replaced smart quotes with ASCII.
- context/sessions/2026-02-08_session-4.md - replaced smart quotes with ASCII.
- docs/architecture/PROJECT_PRIMER.md - removed BOM from the header line; replaced smart quotes with ASCII.
- docs/architecture/architecture.md - removed BOM from the header line.
- docs/architecture/reading-checklist.md - removed BOM from the header line.

## Decisions Made
- Favor strict reading order + explicit extraction goals in handoff over broad "read src/agents" statements, to prevent gaps.

## Learnings
- The handoff is the only reliable anti-compaction mechanism: it must contain the next file order and the specific behavioral questions to answer from each module.

## Notes for Next Session
- Start by reading `docs/architecture/PROJECT_PRIMER.md`, then follow `context/handoffs/current.md` "Next Work (Tomorrow): Strict File Order" exactly.
